Biochar is carbon made of organic matter that's been heated at a very high temperature. It's not the same as charcoal you might find in your fireplace, though. The key difference is how heat is applied. Burning material requires oxygen to feed a fire. Biochar, however, is heated in an oxygen-free environment.

## How is biochar made? 

Biochar is made in a kiln, which is a kind of insulated furnace. Biomass like waste wood or animal waste is dried and compressed into pellets before being put into the kiln for heating. This heating process is called pyrolysis. Since there's no oxygen, CO2 can't be produced, resulting in much fewer emissions.    

The process also creates syngas, which is mostly methane. Syngas is routinely recycled in the process in order to heat the kiln and dry the next batch of biomass. This feedback of electrical and thermal generation can produce the majority of the energy needed to keep the kiln running.

A liquid bio-oil is also produced in pyrolysis. Like syngas, bio-oil can be used as fuel to keep pyrolysis running, but it can also be sequestered underground to prevent emissions through burning it.  

## What is biochar used for?

Biochar is porous, that is, full of tiny gaps. This makes it a great vehicle for water and microorganisms in soil. In that capacity, biochar is often mixed with fertilizers before being added to the soil as an amendment. Farmers have long used biochar as a means of improving soil health, and have enjoyed improved yields as a result.    

Since the carbon structure of biochar is highly stable, it is a reliable way of sequestering emissions that would otherwise be produced if the original biomass was left to decompose naturally. So long as the biomass being used in production is waste, biochar use is considered a net-zero practice.

There are other uses for biochar outside of agriculture. For example, activated carbon like biochar is routinely used in water filtration systems. Graphene is a carbon material used in battery production, and can be derived from biochar.
