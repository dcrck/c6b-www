After a significant amount of work, he repurposed the land into a composting facility.", "This operation ran successfully for years. Over time, the owner learned about biochar and its benefits for soil health and resilience. While biochar was a tried and true soil amendment in agriculture, it took advancements in pyrolysis technology before applying it at a commercial scale was practical.", "Once large-scale pyrolysis technology was tested and proven, a diverse group of entrepreneurs were keen to apply it. After years of development, C6B is now approaching launch. Its biochar production pilot is expected to go live in 2025.", "We're excited to get C6B biochar into fields and to start demonstrating its real benefits for farmers and the environment."]
