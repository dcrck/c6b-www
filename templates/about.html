    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>When I came back from active duty in 2008, it was bad timing. The housing crisis hit us all like a ton of bricks.</p>
    <p>Despite that bumpy road, I found my way into the world of private equity and entrepreneurship. As the economy recovered, I found new opportunities in the coal industry. Even back then, the company I landed with was keen to reduce their emissions, and I was tasked with managing their sequestration projects.</p>
    <p>Things were going steady, but then I met Robert four years ago. Everything changed. See, he had been in the composting business for a long time. He was getting close to retirement and was spending more time thinking about his legacy. So was I.</p>
    <p>My kids were still young, and I was thinking long and hard about the world I wanted to leave them. Was abating the emissions of a coal company good enough for my children? What more could I do to make sure the world was in good shape when they were ready to take the wheel?</p>
    <p>One day Robert told me about biochar. He was used to helping local farmers improve their soil quality. While looking at options beyond compost, he had heard about this amendment that could radically improve water retention and microbial diversity. That was all well and good for farmers, and biochar was similar enough to coal that it felt comfortable to me.</p>
    <p>What really caught my attention was when Robert told me that the way biochar was processed made it a carbon sink. Pyrolysis didn't produce net emissions, and once biochar was in the ground, that carbon would stay there for hundreds or even thousands of years. I was hooked.</p>
    <p>This material was familiar, but different. I could help out my local community, support a worthwhile business legacy, and build a better world for my kids. The other biochar companies out there were only making small volumes. Well, I'm the kind of guy to go big or go home. So we got to work.</p>
    <p>A few years later, and we're just about ready to get our pilot project off the ground. We're so excited to share our work with the world, and we're happy to have you along for the ride.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>In the late 1990s, the owner of a mine site in Temecula(?) in southern California recognized the opportunity in moving away from extractive industries and into the circular economy. After a significant amount of work, he repurposed the land into a composting facility.</p>
    <p>This operation ran successfully for years. Over time the owner learned about biochar and its benefits for soil health and resilience. While biochar was a tried and true soil amendment in agriculture, it took advancements in pyrolysis technology before applying it at a commercial scale was practical.</p>
    <p>Once large-scale pyrolysis technology was tested and proven, a diverse group of entrepreneurs were keen to apply it. After years of development, C6B is now approaching launch. Its biochar production pilot is expected to go live in 2025.</p>
    <p>We're excited to get C6B biochar into fields and to start demonstrating its real benefits for farmers and the environment.</p>

    <h1>The Problem &amp; Our Solution</h1>
    <p>Climate change threatens food security and the livelihood of farmers around the globe. Now is the time to rally around solutions that secure reliable crop yields in the face of unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events.</p> 
    <p>Regenerative farming techniques can support resilience in the face of these challenges. Farmers and consumers alike benefit from solutions that can improve soil health, recycle "waste" material, and sequester carbon - just like biochar.</p>
    <p>Better still, this solution can increase yields to meet ever-increasing demand when traditional crop treatments are eroding long-term growing conditions. This further reduces the need for clearing ecologically valuable land for agricultural use.</p> 
    <p>C6B provides agricultural producers and suppliers with affordable access to biochar, an organic amendment that improves soil quality, water retention, and crop yield while generating high-quality carbon removal credits that support net-zero goals.</p>
